# Illusions of Certainty: what the brain can teach us about Software Engineering

## Abstract

Death and taxes. These are the only things certain in life, as they say. And yet, software developers rely upon a third certainty: computers do what we tell them to and nothing more. When designing software systems, we tend to describe them in terms of “the happy path.” The tests we write reassure us that known scenarios achieve known outcomes. We account for failures as if they happen one at a time. When it comes to software systems in the wild, we often underestimate our uncertainty about their behavior, resulting in outages and late night conference calls. Why do we do this, and why is it a problem? What can we do about it? It turns out that looking at how our brains work provides some clues. Learn the full story during this talk.
